Hello team,

After about 5 years of having a role at this organization... from the co-founder of BBJProjeK, to CEO... to DWG member and CEO... I deciced it's finally time for me to leave

I would like to thank you for all the support and moments during this time. I could not have asked for a better community of people to spend the time with. I am proud of the accomplishments we have made together and I am confident that the organization will still be in good hands.

There's a lot of talk about the importance of a company or organization being "founder-led". I believe that's severely limiting and single point of failure. We've worked hard to ensure this org can break away from its founding and founders (this is, from the initial ideas and values, and from Gabriel Howard (founder) and me (co-founder). There are some reasons I believe now is the right time.

The first is Breyy Graur becoming our CEO. He's been my choice for some time given how he understand the organization and its needs. Breyy has been behind every decision that helped turn this organization and the team around, helped with our services, legal, and financial. He's curious, rational, and demanding. Also self-aware and humble. He will lead the organization in a good way. My trust in him as a CEO is deep.

The second is all of you, the whole team; designers, developers, brother, teammates... We have a lot of ambition and potential as a team, with our own ideas and projects that only takes place here when we make a good team. Breyy started here as a developer for our internal cdn and now he's our CEO. This just makes me proud. I know that Breyy will be able to channel this energy best cause he's lived it and knows what it takes. All of you have the potential to make new projects, for yourself and for the organization as a whole. I believe this with all my heart!

He is CEO starting July 12th, 2024. I'm going to serve on the board through my term to help Breyy with the transition. And after that... I'll leave the board.

I want you all to know that this was my own decision and I own it. It was a tough one for me, of course. I really enjoy staying in this organization, with all learnt things, all those projects made, the hours of coding, and seeing a lot of team members growing their skills here to get their first job, or to rise to a better role in their companies.

We'll have a talk tomorrow 9:00AM at <a href="https://playground.bbjprojek.org/talks/">https://playground.bbjprojek.org/talks/</a>. All the team is invited, remember to join with your bbjprojek.org email.
If you need to contact me, my email <a href="mailto:sergio@bbjprojek.org">sergio@bbjprojek.org</a> will be always available. If you need my "more personal" email, just ask for it. See you soon!

Sincerely
Sergio
