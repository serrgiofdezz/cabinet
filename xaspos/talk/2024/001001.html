RaBBAu Contest 24, part of the RaBBAu Contests, is back after three years. It was known as the BBJProjeK Contests.

In this exciting competition, creators, developers, and innovators come together to showcase their finest open-source projects. It's not just about submitting code-it's about innovation, creativity, and pushing boundaries in the tech space. Whether you're a seasoned pro or a newcomer with a fresh perspective, this contest is designed to bring out the best in you.

This year, the stakes are higher than ever. Winners of RaBBAu Contest 24 will not only gain bragging rights in the open-source community but also take home cash prizes, exclusive mentorship opportunities, and get their work featured across the RaBBAu network.

If you're interested in joining or get more information about this contest, follow the link below. Full guidelines and deadlines are available now.
