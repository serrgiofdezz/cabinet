Following the last date of the SFP Chapter III, the website <a href="https://cabinet.bbjprojek.org">https://cabinet.bbjprojek.org</a>, aka <b>Sergio's Personal Cabinet</b> will be deprecated on the same day the chapter III ends. This date is January 1st, 2025.

According to Sergio, the third chapter of SFP is the last one to have a public availability for users. Chapter III was being offered as a final extension of Chapter I and Chapter II for users using that release, without extra requirements. Now that there are 100 days to the end, there will be no more chapters, and the cabinet will be deprecated.

"<i>Sergio's Personal Cabinet was just a website to hold my progress through my social media detox, as well as encouraging other people to join this task. With the three chapters I can officially say I'm social media-free. And I can proudly say that many people also did thanks to these "SFP Chapters". The final SFP Chapter X booklet is coming soon before the end of the year. This one will help people to take a short or forever break from social media, and prioritize mental health and things that really matter in this world, everything without deadlines, at your own time. Thanks to all people who followed and tried this journey. We see you in the real world</i>"

Organization members could have purchased SFP Chapter III from May 1st, 2024, until two month after SFP Chapter III begins (i.e. June 13th, 2024).
