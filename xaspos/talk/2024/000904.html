After the discussion about what was the new sfp chapter about, I'll explain it in this ticket. The short answe is; there is no such chapter. The last chapter is and will be the current one (SFP Chapter III).

The SFP Chapter IV is just my attempt at quickly fulfilling the contractual obligation after Chapter I, II and III was delivered. This chapter was just rejected by Ragyxo, not surprisingly, and then renegotiated the deal about deprecating and closing the website "Sergio's Personal Cabinet".

So, SFP Chapter IV is not being released, and never will be and I have anything to do with it. After SFP Chapter III ends (January 1st, 2025), the website will only be hosting the BBJProjeK XasPos and the old SFP documentation as well was the PDF of SFP Chapter X.

For anyone still interesed in SilentFootPrint project, we launched the <b>SFP Chapter X Booklet</b>; a manual for reducing social media dependence and limiting online presence. The good thing about this booklet is that you set your own deadlines. The book will help you to set your objectives, times and everything you need to make the "social media detox" effective.
