  <h3 id="description">Description</h3>
  <p>In the community, it appears on numerous billboards and advertisements on several <a href="/docs/authority/radio">radio stations</a>. In the ads, it mentions that it "helps cure stress". Ironically, the company is the official sponsor of the <b>Lapiacery City Marathon</b>.</p>
  <p>AzureSmoke Cigarettes is shown to have existed as far back as 1952, where they advertised smoking for children, as well as having used product placement in an episode of Gordon Moorehead Rides Again. Their vintage mascot appears to have been a stereotypical red-faced Indian (a nod to the use of Native Americans in vintage cigarette advertising). By 2013, they seem to be involved in corrupt political practices, hiring four corrupt jurors to defend the company at a hearing.</p>
  <p>Like its real-life counterparts, AzureSmoke is also involved in sponsoring racing activities, having its name in the <b>Azure's Track</b>, a place popular for off-road races. The cigarettes livery is available on numerous vehicles, including as a customisable feature on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfa_Romeo_Giulia_(2015)">Alfa Romeo Giulia</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chevrolet_Impala_(fourth_generation)">Chevrolet Impala MKIV</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford_Mondeo_(second_generation)">Ford Mondeo MKII</a> and is prominently labeled on the Retro Rally Omnis livery for the Omnis. Its racing liveries are mostly based around the company colors of blue, black and white and typically feature a red diagonal stripe down the sides of the vehicle.</p>

  <h3 id="stations">Stations</h3>
  <p>There are a combined total of 8 dynamic radio stations as of now, with some stations exclusive for our <a href="https://osm.org/node/10706872551">headquarters</a>. Tap on each radio station icon to get the full tracklist, Spotify playlist, streaming instructions and more information about it.</p>

  <h3 id="influence">Influence</h3>
  <p>Redwood is likely based on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucky_Strike">Lucky Strike</a>. The logo bears a close resemblance to Lucky's in typeface, colour scheme, and design. Several of the motorsport liveries for many racing vehicles are based on real life Winston-sponsored vehicles.</p>

  <h3 id="production">Production</h3>
  <p>In 2024, it was estimated by the organization that there were about 280 cigarette packages produced since the creation of the organization (June 2019), mostly brought for special events in late June 2023 from some local stores. The entire 2023 production features the same package design.</p>

  <h3 id="events">Events in The Authority</h3>
  <p>AzureSmoke faces a big lawsuit against their cigarettes. They have paid off four jurors to testify in their favor during the trial. María then sends Dyne to kill the 4 corrupt jurors in The Multi Target Assassination. With all 4 of the jurors dead, AzureSmoke loses the lawsuit, making their stocks suffer a huge drop in value.</p>
  <p>Javan smokes AzureSmokes, has a beard, and is average height and size.</p>

  <h3 id="events-local">Events in Headquarters</h3>
  <p>When on our <a href="https://osm.org/node/10706872551">headquarters</a>, you may smoke AzureSmoke at any given time in the day. All you need to do is to buy a pack of them inside, or at affiliated stores. One package of ten cigarettes costs four euros, and smoking will damage health. However, the damage is so small, it's completely negligible.</p>
